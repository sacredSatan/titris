A tile matching puzzle game made with React 

This is my second game with React, again, the goal is to learn to use React. I haven't made anything like a tile matching game before, so this is a little challenging for me.

### TODO List

- Complete the game
	- ~Move block~
	- Rotate block
	- Fix block collision
	- ~Generate random blocks~
	- ~End the game when a block touches the top~
	- ~Player Score~
- Improve the UX by adding instructions and pause / play control
